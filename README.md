# Bert_Chinese_Ner
You need to down load the bert model.Then put it into the bert_pretrain dir.
Or you may use the hugging face transformers 
I create a notebook in kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/shiki777/bert-ner-chinese it may be helpful to you 
This notebook uses a small part of the dataset you could use the whole dataset and get a better result
